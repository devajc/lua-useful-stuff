Khronos Module to work with TINN
================================

This module contains a fair bit of Khronos APIS.  It is primarily related to OpenGL and supporting interfaces.  There is a convenience runtime module, View3D, which makes it extremely easy to put together an application that has a default window, and default behaviors, such as swapping buffers after drawing the display.

Look at the lesson2.lua and lesson3.lua files for examples of how to implement simple 3D applications using the View3D mechanism.
