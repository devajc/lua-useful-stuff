Stdlib NEWS - User visible changes

* Noteworthy changes in release ?.? (????-??-??) [?]

** New features:

 - Modules have been refactored so that they can be safely
   required individually, and without loading themselves or any
   dependencies on other std modules into the global namespace.

 - Objects derived from the `std.object` prototype have a new
   <derived_object>:type () method that returns the contents of the new
   internal `_type` field.  This can be overridden during cloning with,
   e.g.:

      local Object = require "std.object"
      Prototype = Object { _type = "prototype", <other_fields> }

 - Objects derived from the `std.object` prototype return a new table
   with a shallow copy of all non-internal fields (keys that do not
   begin with "_") when passed to `table.totable` - unless overridden
   in the derived object's __totable field.

 - list, set and strbuf are now derived from std.object, which means that
   they respond to `object.type` with appropriate type names ("set",
   "strbuf", etc.) and can be used as prototypes for further derived
   objects or clones; support object:type (); respond to totable etc.

 - `string.prettytostring` always displays table elements in the same
   order, as provided by `table.sort`.

 - Can now be installed directly from a release tarball by `luarocks`.
   No need to run `./configure` or `make`, unless you want to install to
   a custom location, or do not use LuaRocks.

** Bug fixes:

 - string.escape_pattern is now Lua 5.2 compatible.

** Incompatible changes:

 - `std.object.Object` is now `std.object.new` for consistency with
   the other stdlib types.  Most likely you were already using the
   `std.object {...}` sugar, as shown below, which is unaffected:

     local Object = require "std.object"
     local myobject = Object {_init = {"field1", "field2"}}

 - Following on from the Grand Renaming™ change in the last release,
   `std.debug_ext`, `std.io_ext`, `std.math_ext`, `std.package_ext`,
   `std.string_ext` and `std.table_ext` no longer have the spurious
   `_ext` suffix.  Instead, you must now use, e.g.:

      local string = require "std.string"

   These names are now stable, and will be available from here for
   future releases.


* Noteworthy changes in release 35 (2013-05-06) [stable]

** New features:

 - Move to the Slingshot release system.
 - Continuous integration from Travis automatically builds stdilb
   with Lua 5.1, Lua 5.2 and luajit-2.0 with every commit, which
   should help prevent future release breaking compatibility with
   one or another of those interpreters.

** Bug fixes:

 - `std.package_ext` no longer overwrites the core `package` table,
   leaving the core holding on to memory that Lua code could no
   longer access.

** Incompatible changes:

 - The Grand Renaming™ - everything now installs to $luaprefix/std/,
   except `std.lua` itself.  Importing individual modules now involves:

     local list = require "std.list"

   If you want to have all the symbols previously available from the
   global and core module namespaces, you will need to put them there
   yourself, or import everything with:

     require "std"

   which still behaves per previous releases.

   Not all of the modules work correctly when imported individually
   right now, until we figure out how to break some circular dependencies.


* Noteworthy changes in release 34.1 (2013-04-01) [stable]

** This is a maintenance release to quickly fix a breakage in getopt
   from release v34.  Getopt no longer parses non-options, but stops
   on the first non-option... if a use case for the other method
   comes up, we can always add it back in.


* Noteworthy changes in release 34 (2013-03-25) [stable]

 - stdlib is moving towards supporting separate requirement of individual
   modules, without scribbling on the global environment; the work is not
   yet complete, but we're collecting tests along the way to ensure that
   once it is all working, it will carry on working;
 - there are some requirement loops between modules, so not everything can
   be required independently just now;
 - `require "std"` will continue to inject std symbols into the system
   tables for backwards compatibility;
 - stdlib no longer ships a copy of Specl, which you will need to install
   separately if you want to run the bundled tests;
 - getopt supports parsing of undefined options; useful for programs that
   wrap other programs;
 - getopt.Option constructor is no longer used, pass a plain Lua table of
   options, and getopt will do the rest;


* Noteworthy changes in release 33 (2013-07-27) [stable]

** This release improves stability where Specl has helped locate some
   corner cases that are now fixed.
 - `string_ext.wrap` and `string_ext.tfind` now diagnose invalid arguments.

** Specl code coverage is improving.

** OrdinalSuffix improvements.
 - Use '%' instead of math.mod, as the latter does not exist in Lua 5.2.
 - Accept negative arguments.


* Noteworthy changes in release 32 (2013-02-22) [stable]

** This release fixes a critical bug preventing getopt from returning
   anything in getopt.opt.  Gary V. Vaughan is now a co-maintainer, currently
   reworking the sources to use (Lua 5.1 compatible) Lua 5.2 style module
   packaging, which requires you to assign the return values from your imports:

     getopt = require "getopt"

** Extension modules, table_ext, package_ext etc. return the unextended module
   table before injecting additional package methods, so you can ignore those
   return values or save them for programatically backing out the changes:

     table_unextended = require "table_ext"

** Additionally, Specl (see http://github.com/gvvaughan/specl/) specifications
   are being written for stdlib modules to help us stop accidentally breaking
   things between releases.


* Noteworthy changes in release 31 (2013-02-20) [stable]

** This release improves the list module: lists now have methods, list.slice
   is renamed to list.sub (the old name is provided as an alias for backwards
   compatibility), and all functions that construct a new list return a proper
   list, not a table. As a result, it is now often possible to write code that
   works on both lists and strings.


* Noteworthy changes in release 30 (2013-02-17) [stable]

** This release changes some modules to be written in a Lua 5.2 style (but
   not the way they work with 5.1). Some fixes and improvements were made to
   the build system. Bugs in the die function, the parser module, and a nasty
   bug in the set module introduced in the last release (29) were fixed.


* Noteworthy changes in release 29 (2013-02-06) [stable]

** This release overhauls the build system to have LuaRocks install releases
   directly from git rather than from tarballs, and fixes a bug in set (issue
   #8).


* Noteworthy changes in release 28 (2012-10-28) [stable]

** This release improves the documentation and build system, and improves
   require_version to work by default with more libraries.


* Noteworthy changes in release 27 (2012-10-03) [stable]

** This release changes getopt to return all arguments in a list, rather than
   optionally processing them with a function, fixes an incorrect definition
   of set.elems introduced in release 26, turns on debugging by default,
   removes the not-very-useful string.gsubs, adds constructor functions for
   objects, renames table.rearrange to the more descriptive table.clone_rename
   and table.indices to table.keys, and makes table.merge not clone but modify
   its left-hand argument. A function require_version has been added to allow
   version constraints on a module being required. Gary Vaughan has
   contributed a memoize function, and minor documentation and build system
   improvements have been made. Usage information is now output to stdout, not
   stderr. The build system has been fixed to accept Lua 5.2. The luarock now
   installs documentation, and the build command used is now more robust
   against previous builds in the same tree.


* Noteworthy changes in release 26 (2012-02-18) [stable]

** This release improves getoptâs output messages and conformance to
   standard practice for default options. io.processFiles now unsets prog.file
   when it finishes, so that a program can tell when itâs no longer
   processing a file. Three new tree iterators, inodes, leaves and ileaves,
   have been added; the set iterator set.elements (renamed to set.elems for
   consistency with list.elems) is now leaves rather than pairs. tree indexing
   has been made to work in more circumstances (thanks, Gary Vaughan).
   io.writeline is renamed io.writelines for consistency with io.readlines and
   its function. A slurping function, io.slurp, has been added. Strings now
   have a __concat metamethod.


* Noteworthy changes in release 25 (2011-09-19) [stable]

** This release adds a version string to the std module and fixes a buglet in
   the build system.


* Noteworthy changes in release 24 (2011-09-19) [stable]

** This release fixes a rename missing from release 23, and makes a couple of
   fixes to the new build system, also from release 23.


* Noteworthy changes in release 23 (2011-09-17) [stable]

** This release removes the posix_ext module, which is now part of luaposix,
   renames string.findl to string.tfind to be the same as lrexlib, and
   autotoolizes the build system, as well as providing a rockspec file.


* Noteworthy changes in release 22 (2011-09-02) [stable]

** This release adds two new modules: strbuf, a trivial string buffers
   implementation, which is used to speed up the stdlib tostring method for
   tables, and bin, which contains a couple of routines for converting binary
   data into numbers and strings. Some small documentation and build system
   fixes have been made.


* Noteworthy changes in release 21 (2011-06-06) [stable]

** This release converts the documentation of stdlib to LuaDoc, adds an
   experimental Lua 5.2 module "fstable", for storing tables directly on
   disk as files and directories, and fixes a few minor bugs (with help from
   David Favro).

** This release has been tested lightly on Lua 5.2 alpha, but is not
   guaranteed to work fully.


* Noteworthy changes in release 20 (2011-04-14) [stable]

** This release fixes a conflict between the global _DEBUG setting and the use
   of strict.lua, changes the argument order of some list functions to favour
   OO-style use, adds posix.euidaccess, and adds OO-style use to set. mk1file
   can now produce a single-file version of a user-supplied list of modules,
   not just the standard set.


* Noteworthy changes in release 19 (2011-02-26) [stable]

** This release puts the package.config reflection in a new package_ext
   module, where it belongs. Thanks to David Manura for this point, and for a
   small improvement to the code.


* Noteworthy changes in release 18 (2011-02-26) [stable]

** This release provides named access to the contents of package.config, which
   is undocumented in Lua 5.1. See luaconf.h and the Lua 5.2 manual for more
   details.


* Noteworthy changes in release 17 (2011-02-07) [stable]

** This release fixes two bugs in string.pad (thanks to Bob Chapman for the
   fixes).


* Noteworthy changes in release 16 (2010-12-09) [stable]

** Adds posix module, using luaposix, and makes various other small fixes and
   improvements.


* Noteworthy changes in release 15 (2010-06-14) [stable]

** This release fixes list.foldl, list.foldr, the fold iterator combinator and
   io.writeLine. It also simplifies the op table, which now merely sugars the
   built-in operators rather than extending them. It adds a new tree module,
   which subsumes the old table.deepclone and table.lookup functions.
   table.subscript has become op["[]"], and table.subscripts has been removed;
   the old treeIter iterator has been simplified and generalised, and renamed
   to nodes. The mk1file script and std.lua library loader have had the module
   list factored out into modules.lua. strict.lua from the Lua distribution is
   now included in stdlib, which has been fixed to work with it. Some minor
   documentation and other code improvements and fixes have been made.


* Noteworthy changes in release 14 (2010-06-07) [stable]

** This release makes stdlib compatible with strict.lua, which required a
   small change to the debug_ext module. Some other minor changes have also
   been made to that module. The table.subscripts function has been removed
   from the table_ext.lua.


* Noteworthy changes in release 13 (2010-06-02) [stable]

** This release removes the lcs module from the standard set loaded by
   "std", removes an unnecessary definition of print, and tidies up the
   implementation of the "op" table of functional versions of the infix
   operators and logical operators.


* Noteworthy changes in release 12 (2009-09-07) [stable]

** This release removes io.basename and io.dirname, which are now available in
   lposix, and the little-used functions addSuffix and changeSuffix which
   dependend on them. io.pathConcat is renamed to io.catdir and io.pathSplit
   to io.splitdir, making them behave the same as the corresponding Perl
   functions. The dependency on lrexlib has been removed along with the rex
   wrapper module. Some of the more esoteric and special-purpose modules
   (mbox, xml, parser) are no longer loaded by 'require "std"'.

   This leaves stdlib with no external dependencies, and a rather more
   coherent set of basic modules.


* Noteworthy changes in release 11 (2009-03-15) [stable]

** This release fixes a bug in string.format, removes the redundant
   string.join (it's the same as table.concat), and adds to table.clone and
   table.deepclone the ability to copy without metatables. Thanks to David
   Kantowitz for pointing out the various deficiencies.


* Noteworthy changes in release 10 (2009-03-13) [stable]

** This release fixes table.deepclone to copy metatables, as it should.
   Thanks to David Kantowitz for the fix.


* Noteworthy changes in release 9 (2009-02-19) [stable]

** This release updates the object module to be the same as that published
   in "Lua Gems", and fixes a bug in the utility mk1file which makes a
   one-file version of the library, to stop it permanently redefining require.


* Noteworthy changes in release 8 (2008-09-04) [stable]

** This release features fixes and improvements to the set module; thanks to
   Jiutian Yanling for a bug report and suggestion which led to this work.


* Noteworthy changes in release 7 (2008-09-04) [stable]

** just a bug fix


* Noteworthy changes in release 6 (2008-07-28) [stable]

** This release rewrites the iterators in a more Lua-ish 5.1 style.


* Noteworthy changes in release 5 (2008-03-04) [stable]

** I'm happy to announce a new release of my standard Lua libraries. It's been
   nearly a year since the last release, and I'm happy to say that since then
   only one bug has been found (thanks Roberto!). Two functions have been
   added in this release, to deal with file paths, and one removed (io.length,
   which is handled by lfs.attributes) along with one constant (INTEGER_BITS,
   handled by bitlib's bit.bits).

** For those not familiar with stdlib, it's a pure-Lua library of mostly
   fundamental data structures and algorithms, in particular support for
   functional and object-oriented programming, string and regex operations and
   extensible pretty printing of data structures. More specific modules
   include a getopt implementation, a generalised least common subsequences
   (i.e. diff algorithm) implementation, a recursive-descent parser generator,
   and an mbox parser.

** It's quite a mixed bag, but almost all written for real projects. It's
   written in a doc-string-ish style with the supplied very simple ldoc tool.

** I am happy with this code base, but there are various things it could use:

   0. Tests. Tests. Tests. The code has no unit tests. It so needs them.

   1. More code. Nothing too specialised (unless it's too small to be released
      on its own, although very little seems "too small" in the Lua
      community). Anything that either has widespread applicability (like
      getopt) or is very general (data structures, algorithms, design
      patterns) is good.

   2. Refactoring. The code is not ideally factored. At the moment it is
      divided into modules that extend existing libraries, and new modules
      constructed along similar lines, but I think that some of the divisions
      are confusing. For example, the functional programming support is spread
      between the list and base modules, and would probably be better in its
      own module, as those who aren't interested in the functional style won't
      want the functional list support or the higher-order functions support,
      and those who want one will probably want the other.

   3. Documentation work. There's not a long wrong with the existing
      documentation, but it would be nice, now that there is a stable LuaDoc,
      to use that instead of the built-in ldoc, which I'm happy to discard now
      that LuaDoc is stable. ldoc was always designed as a minimal LuaDoc
      substitute in any case.

   4. Maintenance and advocacy. For a while I have been reducing my work on
      Lua, and am also now reducing my work in Lua. If anyone would like to
      take on stdlib, please talk to me. It fills a much-needed function: I
      suspect a lot of Lua programmers have invented the wheels with which it
      is filled over and over again. In particular, many programmers could
      benefit from the simplicity of its simple and well-designed functional,
      string and regex capabilities, and others will love its comprehensive
      getopt.


* Noteworthy changes in release 4 (2007-04-26) [beta]

** This release removes the dependency on the currently unmaintained lposix
   library, includes pre-built HTML documentation, and fixes some 5.0-style
   uses of variadic arguments.

   Thanks to Matt for pointing out all these problems. stdlib is very much
   user-driven at the moment, since it already does everything I need, and I
   don't have much time to work on it, so do please contact me if you find
   bugs or problems or simply don't understand it, as the one thing I *do*
   want to do is make it useful and accessible!


* Noteworthy changes in release 3 (2007-02-25) [beta]

** This release fixes the "set" and "lcs" (longest common subsequence, or
   "grep") libraries, which were broken, and adds one or two other bug and
   design fixes. Thanks are due to Enrico Tassi for pointing out some of the
   problems.


* Noteworthy changes in release 2 (2007-01-05) [beta]

** This release includes some bug fixes, and compatibility with lrexlib 2.0.


* Noteworthy changes in release 1 (2011-09-02) [beta]

** It's just a snapshot of CVS, but it's pretty stable at the moment; stdlib,
   until such time as greater interest or participation enables (or forces!)
   formal releases will be in permanent beta, and tracking CVS is recommended.
