TINNSnips
=========

This project is a sibling to TINN: http://github.com/Wiladams/TINN  

TINN (TINN Is Not Node) is a simple runtime environment that enables running Windows specific code snippets using the LuaJIT compiler and language.  

TINNSnips are simple example programs that use the TINN runtime to demonstrate what can be done.  

Running a TINNSnip
------------------
  
 Assuming you have already installed the TINN tool in your environment somewhere, you can run a snippet by downloading it to your local environment, using a command line to cd to the directory you downloaded to, and just do: tinn filename.lua.  

 Example - httpserver  
	 tinn staticserver.lua
