# lds - LuaJIT Data Structures

## Introduction

**lds** provides containers, such as lists, maps, and hash tables, which hold [LuaJIT *cdata*](http://luajit.org/ext_ffi_api.html).   

The **lds** implementation is adapted from the libraries at [opendatastructures.org](http://opendatastructures.org), with its interface changed to be closer to the C++ [Standard Template Library (STL)](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/).  

The LuaJIT FFI enables the instantiation and manipulation of C objects directly in Lua; these objects called *cdata*.  Although *cdata* may be stored in Lua tables, they are subject to a 4GB memory limit and GC inefficiency [^1].  Furthermore, a developer may want more application-specific complexity characteristics than what a generic Lua table offers.

**IMPORTANT:**  **lds** requires recent LuaJIT FFI features (parameterized types and __new metamethod).  These were added in June 2012, after beta10 was released.


## Example

The following example shows a *cdata* being held in a HashMap, mapping ID numbers to elements. 

```lua
local ffi = require 'ffi'
local lds = require 'lds/Vector'

ffi.cdef([[
struct Item {
    int    id;
    char   name[16];
    int    inventory;
};
]])

local Item_t = ffi.typeof( 'Item' )

-- Create a Vector and add some items
local v = Vector( Item_t )
v:push_back( Item_t( 100, "Apple",  42 ) )
v:push_back( Item_t( 101, "Orange", 10 ) )
v:push_back( Item_t( 102, "Lemon",   6 ) )
assert( v:size() == 3 )
assert( v:get(0).id == 100 )
assert( v:get(2).id == 102 )
```

Documentation for each container is pretty sparse right now -- try reading the test scripts](https://github.com/neomantra/lds/tree/master/tests).  The source is decently readable (much easier than the STL implementation).

## Containers

**lds** provides a variety of containers.  Most of these interfaces are based on the C++ Standard Template Library](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/).  To understand the implementations and theory, consult the [opendatastructures.org](http://opendatastructures.org/ods-cpp/) ("ODS") documentation.

  * Array-Based sequences ([ODS](http://opendatastructures.org/ods-cpp/2_Array_Based_Lists.html))

    * Array - a static array, akin to [std::array](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/array/).

    * Vector - a dynamic array with an interface based on [std::vector](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/vector/).  This is a good alternative to storing *cdata* in a Lua table and using [table.insert](http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#pdf-table.insert) / [table.remove](http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#pdf-table.remove). ([ODS](http://opendatastructures.org/ods-cpp/2_1_Fast_Stack_Operations_U.html))

    * Queue - a FIFO (first-in-first-out) queue, backed by an array, with an interface based on [std::queue](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/queue/). ([ODS](http://opendatastructures.org/ods-cpp/2_3_Array_Based_Queue.html))

    * Deque - a double-ended queue, backed by an array, with an interface based on [std::deque](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/deque/).  ([ODS](http://opendatastructures.org/ods-cpp/2_4_Fast_Deque_Operations_U.html)).  **some tests are failing, it is broken I think**

 * Sets and Maps

    * HashSet - a chained hash-table set, with an interface based on [std::unordered_set](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/unordered_set/). It is a `set` in the STL sense, in that it can contain only one of a given value.  ([ODS](http://opendatastructures.org/ods-cpp/5_1_Hashing_with_Chaining.html))

    * HashMap - a chained hash-table map, with an interface based on [std::unordered_map](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/unordered_map/). It is a `map` in the STL sense, in that it can contain only one value for a given key.  ([ODS](http://opendatastructures.org/ods-cpp/5_1_Hashing_with_Chaining.html))

    * **TODO: ordered sets/maps based on red-black trees


## Installation

This library is currently only available as a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/neomantra/lds).  

To install, clone the repo and put the contained **lds** directory somewhere on your LUA_PATH.

  
## Usage

For each container type `Container`, there are two constructor functions: `ContainerT` and `Container` .  `ContainerT` takes a FFI `ct` and returns a `ctype` which can be used to create multiple containers of the same type.   `Container` takes a FFI `ct` and returns an actual container object.

```lua
local double_t = ffi.typeof('double')

-- Use the T form to create a new type and instantiate some queues.
local dq_t = lds.ArrayQueueT( double_t )
local q1 = dq_t()
local q2 = dq_t()

-- Use the regular form to directly create a queue
-- This is less efficient if you are creating many queues of the same type.
local q = lds.ArrayQueue( double_t )
```

## Caveats

**All indexed access is 0-based, *not* 1-based.**

**All the arrays are created with malloc/free.  You probably only want to store simple data.  In other words, not structs that use with __new and __gc metamethods**

** Right now the hash function is identity (hash(x) = x), so keys are limited to simple numeric types (I think).

## TODO

  * Implement RedBlackTree
  
  * Test Deque
  
  * Document each class

  * Rockspec

  * Implement the rest of ODS?  Here's what's available:
    * Array-based Lists: DualArrayDeque, RootishArrayStack
    * Linked Lists:  SLList, DLList, SEList
    * Skiplists:  SkiplistSSet, SkiplistList
    * Hash Tables:  LinearHashTable
    * Binary Trees:  BinaryTree, BinarySearchTree, Treap, ScapegoatTree, 
    * Heaps:  BinaryHeap, MeldableHeap
    * Graphs:  AdjacencyMatrix, AdjacencyLists
    * Integer Structures: BinaryTrie, XFastTrie, YFastTrie

  * Iterators

  * Allocators (currently use malloc/free)
    * realloc in model?

  * Algorithms
