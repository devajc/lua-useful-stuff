# Lua stuff

Lua is an obscure little language, but it has some really unique features and is gaining
popularity in the last time. It is intergrated into:

  - http://tylerneylon.com/a/learn-lua/
  - https://sites.google.com/site/marbux/home/where-lua-is-used
  - Redis (http://redis.io/commands/eval)
  - Nginx (https://github.com/chaoslawful/lua-nginx-module)
  - Postgresql (http://pllua.projects.pgfoundry.org/)
  - MySQL Proxy
  - allows scripting NetBSD kernel (http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTMwMTU#n)
  - powers a low-level virtualized Ethernet switch for software defined networks: SnabbSwitch (https://github.com/SnabbCo/snabbswitch/wiki)
  - and powers many-many iOS games



Shortly: IT'S GETTING HOT! )))

In this repo I want to collect some interesting Lua projects, that I have found on Github. Since there is a slight possibility of them just disapearing, I have added them with `git subtree`command, that allows future updates and still retains the full sourcecode here.

see [00.pull.rb](https://github.com/mindreframer/lua-useful-stuff/blob/master/00.pull.rb)  for the code.
